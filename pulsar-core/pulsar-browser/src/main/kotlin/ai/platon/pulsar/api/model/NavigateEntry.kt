/**
 * Tracks the lifecycle state of a single browser navigation.
 *
 * A [NavigateEntry] is created when the user initiates navigation — by typing a URL, clicking a link,
 * or through programmatic action — and is progressively updated as the browser emits network and frame
 * events. It serves as the shared mutable context between the CDP event layer
 * ([ChromeNavigateEntry][ai.platon.pulsar.chrome.network.ChromeNavigateEntry]) and the high-level
 * driver API ([AbstractWebDriver][ai.platon.pulsar.api.AbstractWebDriver]).
 *
 * ## Identity
 *
 * Equality, hashing, and ordering are based solely on [userTypedUrl]: two entries are equal if they
 * share the same user-typed URL, regardless of differences in any other field. This allows collection
 * lookups by URL string. The deprecated [url] property is a computed alias for [userTypedUrl].
 *
 * ## Thread safety
 *
 * Mutable fields are updated from CDP event callbacks on the browser's event thread. Use [synchronized]
 * to guard compound reads and writes across threads.
