# Use Cases for Browser4 Agent Testing

This directory contains use case files for end-to-end testing of the Browser4 agent.

## Directory Structure

Each `.txt` file represents a single use case that can be executed by the Browser4 agent.

## File Format

Each use case file contains:
- **Comment lines** (starting with `#`) - Description and metadata
- **Task content** - The actual steps for the agent to execute

### Example:
```
# Use Case 1: E-commerce Product Comparison (Single-site)
# Level: Simple
# Type: Single-site, deterministic
# Description: Compare mechanical keyboards on Amazon

1. go to https://www.amazon.com/
2. search for "mechanical keyboard"
3. open the first 3 products
4. extract price, rating, and review count
5. write a comparison table to a markdown file
```

## Use Case Levels

- **Simple** (Level 1): Single-site, deterministic workflows
- **Complex** (Level 2): Agentic reasoning, loops, aggregation, cross-site workflows
- **Enterprise** (Level 3): Long-running, auditable, SSO authentication

## Running Tests

Run these use cases via the project's E2E test runner:

For agent-driven scenario tests that can be run directly from the command line, see
[`browser4-tests/real-world-scenarios/`](../../../../../../../../../browser4-tests/real-world-scenarios/README.md).

## Adding New Use Cases

1. Create a new `.txt` file with a numbered prefix (e.g., `15-new-use-case.txt`)
2. Add comment lines for description and metadata
3. Add the task steps (numbered list)

The test runner will automatically discover and execute new use cases.

## Reference

These use cases are designed to be run by the Browser4 E2E test suite runner.
